Spotify is a digital music service that gives users access to millions of songs and has a huge client base all around the world. Driven by the interest in music and the data, I choose to explore more from the data of Spotify. My goal is to build a “Top 50” music dataset with different categories of songs, including 63 lists of different countries and areas as well as global. The data is created by the information of songs and artists and also based on a daily playlist from Spotify users. I would like our data to show the popularity of certain songs, artists and categories.

Based on my dataset, there will be some potential users and applications for multiple purposes:

1. Analyst - The dataset can be provided to analysts for data analysis
2. Events organizer - The dataset can be used as a reference for companies to know which songs their singers are going to choose on their world tour
3. Record company - The dataset could help record companies decide which singers have unlimited potential and are worth investing in. And for the current singers in their company, this dataset can help the company to decide what type of songs need to be made to open the target foreign market. 
4. Listener - The dataset allows listeners to quickly know about the most popular type of music and singers in other countries
