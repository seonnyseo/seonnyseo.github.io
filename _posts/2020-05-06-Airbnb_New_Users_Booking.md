### 1. Introduction

While I am in quarantine due to the COVID, I would like to develop and sharpen my skills for data analysis and data science. XGBoost, which is a popular framework in the Kaggle, data science field and I have no experience before, was an interesting subject to me and I decided to jump in.

[Airbnb recruiting competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings/overview) which was held in Kaggle about 4years ago looks suitable to me since many participants have shared their works using XGBoost, and the goal of this contest is interesting. Airbnb asked to predict new users' first destination with the users' demographic, summary statistics, and their web session records.

Simply I focused on using and learning the XGBoost framework at first, but my attention has been extended to analyze users' data and adopt funnel analysis(AARRR) on it. 

So I will talk about Explatory data anlaysis includes AARRR, and predicting models below.
